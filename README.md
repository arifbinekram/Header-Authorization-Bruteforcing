# Header Authorization Bruteforcing

This project is a Python script designed to perform brute force attacks on HTTP headers, specifically focusing on the `Authorization` header. The script tests multiple passwords against a given URL to check for successful authentication using HTTP Basic Authentication.

## Features

- Reads a list of passwords from a file (`passwords.txt`).
- Attempts to authenticate using each password with a specified URL.
- Provides feedback on the success or failure of each password attempt.
- Outputs any errors encountered during the HTTP requests.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arifbinekram/Header-Authorization-Bruteforcing.git
   cd Header-Authorization-Bruteforcing
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**

   The script requires Python 3 and the `requests` library. Install the required package using pip:

   ```bash
   pip3 install requests
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your passwords list:**

   Create a file named `passwords.txt` in the root directory of the project. List all the passwords you want to try, one per line. For example:

   ```
   123456
   password
   admin
   letmein
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   Execute the script using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 bruteforce.py
   ```

3. **Enter the URL when prompted:**

   The script will ask for a URL input. Provide the URL you want to test for authorization.

## Output

- **Password Failure:** Outputs a message indicating that the password failed for HTTP Basic Authentication.
- **Login Success:** Indicates when a password successfully authenticates.
- **Error Handling:** Reports any unexpected HTTP status codes or exceptions that occur during requests.
